      "It makes sense, for those who prefer the night. I do as well. I believe it has something to do with it being dark, so we are less visible. More metaphorical than anything tho I believe. \n",

There have been so many studies done, especially in prisons, where people left to their own devices, with no human contact , went insane, literally. It gets easier tho , being locked away, if you say for example have a book. Th point is not just because we're social animals, its about keeping the mind busy. We can survive mostly alone, but we must be entertained. Its the price we pay, our burden, for having these incredible brains. \n",

      "I work nights so it works out that way anyway .. on nights off when I have the chance to be awake during the next day I have no desire to be around people, I don't even like seeing the sun. For years I've stayed up half the night sometimes the full night just so I wouldn't have to be awake during the day 😂\n",

      "I did this in the summer \n",
      "I've been tossing around the idea of turning myself fully nocturnal again. I used to live that way, waking up at sunset and going to bed at dawn. It was nice because I didn't have to interact with anyone unless they were up when they shouldn't have been.\n",
      "It doesn't sound as nice though when I mention that the impetus behind doing that was to completely isolate myself from humanity and avoid having to live an actual life. At this point my adhedonia is so bad that I don't think I could even find the night relaxing anymore. \n",
      "I sleep so I can avoid now\n",
      "I have done it for a different reason. I guess it gave me the illusion of getting the next day over with already. It was a work day and you can guess I didn't wake up fully alert which caised me to loose my job.\n",
      "I do exactly the opposite. I just stay sleeping too much to avoid today. And tomorrow I'll do the same.\n",
      "Yes, I feel like I'm delaying the next shitty day.\n",
      "All the time, then my day at work is hard because I'm even more tired than normal.\n",
      "Usually when I'm home (I'm in school now and my depression isn't severe as it was) I stay up all night so I can avoid my anxiety from keeping me awake. Like, I'd lie there trying to sleep but my worries and shit would torture me so I'd stay up and distract myself. \n",
      "And I was trying to figure out what your question meant, but then I realized I did do this. Like, staying up late so you don't have to sleep and wake up and it be the next day. Yep\n",
      "Yes   .... I hope sad days don't come. Sometimes you can't avoid bad people interfere your life decisions...\n",
      "Absolutely. I also feel its an act of defiance... You can take my 9-5, 5 days a week...but I will push my bed time as an assertion of gaining more freedom. I still hate myself in the morning. \n",
      "Me - I know that when I wake up hella early, it's because something isn't right. I used to sleep in and feel great. Now I can't stay asleep past 8:00am.\n",
      "When I'm not working, my body clock eventually has me waking up at 1-2pm, and I'll stay up til 6-8am befor falling asleep. \n",
      "Interesting, I never thought about why I tend to stay up super late even when I'm tired enough to sleep and have to get up early the next morning. Maybe this is why.\n",
      "yes, i stay up for days just so i won't be conscious enough during the day to care about what's going on, i guess better than being high \n",
      "Worse, after I wake up and I'm on the clock to get to work on time, I just mope around and sit on my bed and stare at my hands or whatever because I'm avoiding the day.\n",
      "Been there. Remember it passes. It's part of depression. \n",
      "Yes I do this most nights during the week when I work and then I more or less crash on the weekend. My favorite part of the day is lying alone in the dark and knowing that for at least a little while, I'm not responsible for anything and have no expectations to meet. \n",
      "\n",
      "I usually just drink a lot of coffee to get me through the day. \n",
      "\n",
      "I believe Napoleon had some quote about leaving his problems with his boots when he gets into bed and thats exactly how I feel. He also had a quote about men only needing 6 hours of sleep at most. I wonder if the quotes are related. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is the only reason I stay up late. To attempt to prolong tomorrow \n",
      "I always stay up late because I was too tired/depressed to deal with my responsibilities, so I try to extend the \"deadline\" by making the day last longer. Then the next day it repeats because I stayed up too late.\n",
      "Yes, but oddly enough tomorrow still arrives\n",
      "yea exactly what i do \n",
      "me too thanks \n",
      "This is so ironic considering my sleep schedule has been screwed up lately and it's 4am right now. I never looked at it that way, but now that I think of it, perhaps I subconsciously do it for that very reason.\n",
      "I despise myself for wasting the day. Putting off my responsibilities while just procrastinating until it becomes clear I won't do them. But at night I'm not wasting the day. I'm living on time borrowed from sleep. It's a time where I am not meant to be productive and as a result, I'm not, and that's OK. In the day I am a waste of potential, reducing whatever capabilities I have down to staring at a screen. At night I am an overachiever, faffing around on a computer while the only thing a really should be doing is sleeping.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also like the time before the sun comes up around 4-6 am probably for the same reason. Everything's still asleep and its very quiet.\n",
      "Hell no I run out of things to do so quickly. The days are too long. Also I need to sleep to keep as much as sanity I can. \n",
      "every single day\n",
      "Not really, when i feel bad i prefer to sleep, a lot. Last mo th i slept 10-14h hours daily when usually i sleep 8-7h.\n",
      "That and I cant sleep sometimes. If I try to sleep early my brain just goes through a cycle of bad thoughts untill I decide im gonna watch videos till im fully exhausted.\n",
      "I just hate the thought that in the morning I have to wake up again\n",
      "Yes. I've just done this. Stayed up until 5am, couldn't sleep till 7... managed a few hours and here I am, a zombie \n",
      "Yes, I've recently stopped drinking which helps.\n",
      "Yes, no one understands this about me. I tried to explain this to my mom, but she wasn't hearing it, so I just describe it as insomnia. It's also the only time that I'm the only one awake. No one to judge me or stare at me or hate me. It's relaxing. \n",
      "Yes. I feel like I always want to stay up late so I can extend my free time before I have to go to work the next day. \n",
      "Lately, I've been trying to remind myself that tomorrow is coming, no matter what I do, and the longer I stay up, the worse it will be.  \n",
      "I've had mixed results.\n",
      "I certainly do \n",
      "I more so find myself sleeping/wanting to sleep so I can get rid of today and the next day, and the next. \n",
      "Too often\n",
      "Yep yep yep! I convince myself if I don't go to sleep, then tomorrow can never come, and that means all the stuff I have to do doesn't happen. I actually make myself so anxious that then even if I wanna sleep I can't, because then I'll open my eyes and the thing I didn't want to do is right there!\n",
      "\n",
      "And it sucks that I can't go to bed at night, and then can't get out of bed in the morning.\n",
      "Yep and the fact that it's more calm at night \n",
      "One of these days it just might work too...\n",
      "Hah. I stay up really late so I sleep through the day \n",
      "Like every night lol\n",
      "All the time. It's nice because it's quiet and generally nights are considered unproductive by society, so you don't end up feeling bad that all you do is listen to music and watch youtube.\n",
      "Pretty much. \n",
      "\n",
      "Which was stupid and reckless idea, it only makes your depression worse.\n",
      "Its what im doing right now\n",
      "all the time\n",
      "Yes.  It is nice because I after I stay up late, I can go to sleep.  Sleep is so great if you think about it.  A pause in EVERYTHING about life.  \n",
      "My husband works nights and he's who i can talk to the most so i'll stay up texting him all night....sometimes more than when he's home...but i stay up all night dreading work in the morning where I have to put on a \"mask\" and face customers :(\n",
      "If I could only slow down time. Finish what I need to do so I can go to bed at a normal hour.\n",
      "I just feel safer when I can't see everything that bothers me, you know? It's like it's not there if I can't see it. I really do dread tomorrows. \n",
      "I like lying awake at night because I can be alone with my thoughts and I don't feel like I need to be doing something else.\n",
      "I used to feel that way. The darkness would comfort me and the silence would allow my mind to peacefully imagine a place where I had no problems. Then one day that darkness lost its comfort, and it felt suffocating. Not because I didn't feel comfortable, but because that comfort from the night was all I had left. Don't let yourself get to that point. As someone else in the comments said, if you find yourself blending into the darkness, seek an alternative, seek help! Therapy can do wonders. Always exhaust all your options before giving up, give yourself at least that much. Therapy has a weird stigma, but do your own research and analyze on your own. I can provide one piece of research but I urge you to search more to see what else you can do to find comfort in look forward to tomorrow instead! If you want to see someones perspective on therapy and how it helped take a look at: https://medium.com/advo/therapy-is-dope-b60a3523e55a\n",
